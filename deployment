Deployments
A Deployment provides declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets.

You describe a desired state in a Deployment, and the Deployment Controller changes the actual state to the desired state at a controlled rate. You can define Deployments to create 
new ReplicaSets, or to remove existing Deployments and adopt all their resources with new Deployments.

  apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:

  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:

    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.14.2
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
The Deployment creates a ReplicaSet that creates three replicated Pods, indicated by the .spec.replicas field.
